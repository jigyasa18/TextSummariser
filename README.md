#Text Summariser

Used NLTK in Python to build a summariser. Stored the frequency in a table of all the words and calculated score 
of each sentence by adding the frequency of each word in the sentence. The summary is made up of all the sentences 
with score averaged over number of words they have being above a certain threshold.
