“Children’s Day is the most auspicious day in the life of every child. In India, Children’s Day is celebrated on 14th November every year to commemorate 
the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. He loved children dearly and is fondly remembered as Chacha Nehru by them. 
After his death in 1964, his birthday was declared as Children’s Day nationwide.

Pandit Nehru was very fond of kids and advocated children’s education as he strongly believed that they were the future leaders of the nation. He was a 
strong believer of instilling rich moral virtues in children. He was of the opinion that children should be moulded from a young age properly so that 
they can become productive and responsible citizens of the country.

On this special day, most schools across the country celebrate it by organising socio-cultural programmes for children. Some of the events include poetry, 
recitation, fancy dress competition, singing and dancing events, skits and plays for children. Besides refreshments, kids are also gifted toys, clothes, 
stationery, chocolates, toffees and other interesting goodies. Sometimes, they also watch child-friendly films and shows.

Children’s Day therefore emphasises the importance of showering love and affection to each child. It is celebrated with great fervour and enthusiasm 
across the country. Every child cherishes this day as he/she gets to enjoy it to the fullest. It is important to remember that this special occasion 
is celebrated to take Pandit Nehru’s dream of providing quality education to each child so that they can become the future building blocks of the nation 
and contribute towards the greater benefit of the society.”
